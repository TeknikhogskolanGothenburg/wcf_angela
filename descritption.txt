1.I have done exception from both server side and client side to check if a customer ID exists.
If an ID doesn't exit, the server side will throw new FaultException to catch the error.
2.I have chosen to use 2 bindings which are wsHTTPbinding and netTCPbinding since both bindings has security enabled. 
wsHTTPbinding is secure at the message level and netTCPbinding is secure at the transport level.
